It so happens that sometimes, at work or in other situations, I have to solve problems of math, physics or whatever ... In such cases, I am happy to find that someone had the same problem before I was obliging enough to share his/her solution on the web.

If any thought has the potential to spark curiosity and new ideas, it is worth sharing. Hopefully someone might find an interest in what I write.

The other advantage of this blog is strictly personal. I want to improve my writing skills and keeping this blog is probably good practice which would eventually contribute to teach me how to express myself.
