# This website

This is a personal page where I share thoughts and ideas on topics that interest me. I also share personal reviews of some of the books that I have read. I am a physicist by training which explains why many of my posts have to do with science and mathematics.

# The author

I am currently a postdoc at the Royal Observatory of Belgium where I do research on the dynamics of the deep interior of the Earth, other planets and moons. I specialize in mathematical modeling based on the resolution of partial differential equations, using analytical and numerical methods. My main focus is to study of the fluid dynamics of the liquid layers of planets (core and ocean) and their interaction with tides, rotation and magnetic fields.

I did my PhD on the applications of numerical relativity to problems of cosmology. More specifically, I built numerical model to study how large objects like galaxies or cluster of galaxies can form in an expanding Universe.
