The aim of this blog is not to teach anything to anyone. It is rather intended as my own humble contribution to the shared knowledge of the world wide web. It just so happens that sometimes, at work or in other situations, I have to solve problems of math, physics or whatever ... When that is the case, I am always happy to find that someone has been facing the problem before I did and has been obliging enough to share his/her solution on the web.

The advantage of sharing one's thought goes well beyond problem solving, though. A healthy mind is a curious mind. And so any thought that has the potential to spark curiosity and new ideas is worth sharing. Hopefully someone might find an interest in what I write.

The last advantage of this blog is strictly personal. I wish to improve my writing skills and keeping this blog should be good practice which would eventually contribute to teach me how to express myself in a clear and logical way.
